CORD-19 search app
==================

The team behind `vespa.ai <https://vespa.ai/>`_ have built and open-sourced a `CORD-19 search engine <https://cord19.vespa.ai/>`_.
Thanks to advanced Vespa features such as
`Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search <https://blog.vespa.ai/approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-in-vespa-part-1/>`_
and `Transformers support via ONNX <https://blog.vespa.ai/introducing-nlp-with-transformers-on-vespa/>`_ it comes with
the most advanced NLP methodology applied to search that is currently available.

In this tutorial we illustrate how to evaluate and improve this application.
