Numbers under 10 have a zero in front (called a leading zero); e.g. 09:07. Under the <hi>24</hi>-hour clock system, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59 and ends at <hi>24</hi>:00, which is identical to 00:00 of the following day. 12:00 can only be mid-day. Midnight is called <hi>24</hi>:00 and is used to mean the end of the day and 00:00 is used to mean the beginning of the day. For example, you would say \"Tuesday at <hi>24</hi>:00\" and \"Wednesday at 00:00\" to mean exactly the same time.',\n",
