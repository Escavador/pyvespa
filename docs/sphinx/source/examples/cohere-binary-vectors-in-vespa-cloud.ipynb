More on [hamming distance in Vespa](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#hamming).\n","\n","Vespa supports `hamming` distance with and without [hnsw indexing](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html). \n","\n","For those wanting to learn more about binary vectors, we recommend our 2021 blog series on [Billion-scale vector search with Vespa](https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn/) \n","and [Billion-scale vector search with Vespa - part two](https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn-part-two/).\n","\n","![img](https://blog.vespa.ai/assets/2022-01-27-billion-scale-knn-part-two/throughput.png)\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates how to use the Cohere binary vectors with Vespa, including \n","a re-ranking phase that uses the float query vector version for improved accuracy. From the Cohere blog announcement:\n","\n","> To improve the search quality, the float query embedding can be compared with the binary document embeddings using dot-product. So we first retrieve 10*top_k results with the binary query embedding, and then rescore the binary document embeddings with the float query embedding. This pushes the search quality from 90% to 95%. \n","\n","Install the dependencies:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"daf34cf5","metadata":{"id":"4ffa3cbe"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip3 install -U pyvespa cohere==4.57"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b3f11700","metadata":{},"source":["## Examining the Cohere embeddings\n","\n","Let us check out the Cohere embedding API and how we can obtain binarized embeddings.
